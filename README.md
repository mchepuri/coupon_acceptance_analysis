### Independent Investigation

**Investigation 1**

One important dimension, what time the highest number of coupons got accepted and which caytegory
For that we can group by time first and then by coupon ( category).
The sum will give us the total number of coupons gets accepted at that time range for that category

 Key Observation(s)
 ----------------
 1. Most of the drivers appears to have accepted the coupons at "Economy" restaurants at 2PM and 6PM.
 2. Coffe house seems to the most popular at all times except 10PM. with highest at 10AM (576)  So better NOT to send coffe house coupomns at 10 PM
 3. Suprisingly bar coupons are being accepted at 7AM. A possinbility to check outliers here?
